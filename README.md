How ready i'm I to start new step in your career's Path

I'm partially prepared with th necessary skills and knowledge that requires more practice.

Any thought that you want to talk about especially the skills you gain during the Bootcamp?
Yes. 
During the training I have learnt that despite what initially looks difficult it gets easier with more research,
practice, and the learning never stops.

Skills gained:
Using of CSS properties to improve the appearance of the interface. This can be used broadly with other programs.
The skills on JavaScript that gives life to the project by making the content responsive. That is a click, a popup, etc.
Learning on Postman, MongoDB and Mongoose gained skills in Database use and management.
Skills in react and Next js using axios or Fetch to retrieve data allows for the interconnection between database and interface.
